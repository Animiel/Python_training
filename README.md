# Python_training

This will be the main repository, intended to train / experiment with Python, especially the basics as seen in the course (link below).

This will include chapter 16 exercises of this course (realized before) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwAFL1597eM&t=6364s
The result won't necessary be the same, but I will want to keep a more personnalized trace.

Moreover I got some other little "games" ideas of my own that I will add in this repository and to the "arcade".
